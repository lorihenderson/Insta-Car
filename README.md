# Welcome to InstaCar, our awesome Capstone project!

This is our final project for Kenzie Academy, a group effort. Woot Woot! We are creating an Instagram-like photo-sharing service, geared specifically for car enthusiasts.

## Features

Once complete, users will be able to create accounts, and upload photos of their favorite cars to share with other car enthusiasts. From hot rods to Volkswagens to Teslas -- all cars are welcome at Insta-Car!

We hope to have the ability to search through the database of photos for specific car models.

Perhaps users will be able to message each other?

## Work in progress

Any features we want to add in the future, that we didn't get a chance to add for the school project. We can expand on it later!

## Credits

Authors: Jessica Benson, Lori Henderson, Ken Stephens and John Wilkinson.

Shout-outs to anyone who helped us on the project, instructors, classmates, etc.

## Acknowledgements
